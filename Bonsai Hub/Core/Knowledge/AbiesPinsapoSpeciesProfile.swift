            The primary operational rule is: Preserve healthy foliage and viable buds before major reduction.

            Do not assume that completely bare old wood will reliably regenerate useful replacement growth.

            Before removing branches or major sections: identify viable buds, identify retained foliage, identify replacement options and assess the health and vigour of the tree.

            Major work should be staged where necessary.

            Avoid combining multiple major stresses without a clear reason.

            The objective is: Healthy roots · Preserved foliage · Controlled vigour · Natural structure · Long-term development.

            The individual tree must always be assessed according to climate, tree condition, vigour, development stage and winter temperatures.
